## Random Number Data Visualizations

[Live Demo](https://react-socket-client.herokuapp.com/)

## Project Overview

The sections below will provide details of the project and the technologies used.

### Tech Stack

#### React.js (https://reactjs.org/)

ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library created by facebook that provides tools for building reusable UI components.
This project takes advantage of create-react-app that allows users to build React applications with zero-configuration.

#### Heroku (https://www.heroku.com/)

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service that allows developers to deploy, manage, and scale applications. Herok uses "dynos", isolated, vitualized Linux containers to execute code based on user commands.

#### react-chartjs-2 (https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2)

react-chartjs-2 is a React wrapper for Chart.js, a lightweight JavaScript library that allows users to draw charts using the HTML5 canvas element. Chart.js is open source and delivers responsive elements with no configuration.

#### @data-ui (https://github.com/williaster/data-ui)

@data-ui is a collection of custom and wrapped components created for React, and build on d3. @data-ui uses vx, a library that creates visualization components with d3 for React. The library used in this project is [histogram] which accepts both binned and un-binned data for simple configuration.

#### socket.io-client (https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client)

socket.io-client is a library that connects a client side application to a socket.io server with ease.

#### semantic-ui-react (https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React)

The semantic-ui-react library is the official React integration for Semantic-UI.

### Use Instructions

This project is intended to provide a visualization for random numbers generated by the socket.io server. The user can define a threshold to alert them if the incoming number exceeds their threshold.

## Download Repository 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickbrinser/react-task.git
```

```bash
cd react-task
```

```bash
yarn
```

### Run local development environment

After the following command is run the application will be visible on http://localhost:3000, and random numbers will start being logged in the console after the client is connected.

```bash
yarn run dev
```

### Deployment to Heroku

Deployment is currently handled through the Heroku CLI. Please ensure you follow the instructions provided by Heroku (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git)

## Known Issues

1. Application does not scale correctly for mobile devices in portrait mode.
2. Data is not removed from charts after a period of time causing the series and labels to become difficult to read. 

## Future Plans

Future development and improvements 

* better mobile respsonsiveness
* improved unit test coverage
* remove older data from charts so they stay legible
